# `projectvalidator`

A code library to validate HC-MID editorial projects.


## Current version: 7.0.0

Status:  **active development**. [Release notes](releases.md)

The `master` branch includes work on a forthcoming API-breaking 7.0.0 release, and its current state at any moment is not guaranteed to be coherent. It should be used for building from source only for bleeding-edge purposes.  The source package published on bintray with the 6.7.0 release will compile and function as tested against the 6.7.0 API.
